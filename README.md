# About Me 👋
Hi there! I’m an entry-level Data Scientist skillful in Python, ML algorithms, model building, advanced data analysis and visualization.
Here's more about me: 
- 👋  I'm currently working on building and experimenting with various ML models, bridging the gap between learning and real-world applications.
- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving predictive modelling, customer behaviour analytics, ML and Generative AI Applications.
- 🌱 I’m looking for help with optimizing advanced machine learning tasks in business and research environments.

- � Fun Fact: I turn raw data into stories that make sense—like translating a foreign language only computers speak. By day, I find trends and insights in the numbers, and by night, I imagine what they’d say if they could talk. I see data like a puzzle waiting to be solved—whether it's uncovering trends or building predictive models. Data isn’t just my job; it’s my playground.
